Growing a List: Append
We can add a single element to a list using the .append() Python method.

Suppose we have an empty list called garden:

garden = []
We can add the element "Tomatoes" by using the .append() method:

garden.append("Tomatoes")
 
print(garden)
Will output:

['Tomatoes']
We see that garden now contains "Tomatoes"!

When we use .append() on a list that already has elements, our new element is added to the end of the list:

# Create a list
garden = ["Tomatoes", "Grapes", "Cauliflower"]
 
# Append a new element
garden.append("Green Beans")
print(garden)
Will output:

['Tomatoes', 'Grapes', 'Cauliflower', 'Green Beans']
Letâ€™s use the .append() method to manipulate a list.
