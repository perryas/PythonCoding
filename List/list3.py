Empty Lists
A list doesn’t have to contain anything. You can create an empty list like this:

empty_list = []
Why would we create an empty list?

Usually, it’s because we’re planning on filling it up later based on some other input. We’ll talk about two ways of filling up a list in the next exercise.

Let’s practice writing an empty list!

Instructions
1.
Create an empty list and call it my_empty_list. Don’t put anything in the list just yet.

my_empty_list = []
