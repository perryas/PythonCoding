The Power of Range!
By default, range() creates a list starting at 0. However, if we call range() with two inputs, we can create a list that starts at a different number.

For example, range(2, 9) would generate numbers starting at 2 and ending at 8 (just before 9):

my_list = range(2, 9)
print(list(my_list))
Would output:

[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
If we use a third input, we can create a list that “skips” numbers.

For example, range(2, 9, 2) will give us a list where each number is 2 greater than the previous number:

my_range2 = range(2, 9, 2)
print(list(my_range2))
Would output:

[2, 4, 6, 8]
We can skip as many numbers as we want!

For example, we’ll start at 1 and skip in increments of 10 between each number until we get to 100:

my_range3 = range(1, 100, 10)
print(list(my_range3))
Would output:

[1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91]
Our list stops at 91 because the next number in the sequence would be 101, which is greater than 100 (our stopping point).

Let’s experiment with our additional range() inputs!

Instructions
1.
Modify the range() function that created the range range_five_three such that it:

Starts at 5
Has a difference of 3 between each item
Ends before 15
Checkpoint 2 Passed

Stuck? Get a hint
2.
Create a range called range_diff_five that:

Starts at 0
Has a difference of 5 between each item
Ends before 40

"""

# Your code below: 

range_five_three = range(5, 15, 3)

range_diff_five = range(0, 40, 5)
