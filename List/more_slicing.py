Slicing Lists II
Slicing syntax in Python is very flexible. Let’s look at a few more problems we can tackle with slicing.

Take the list fruits as our example:

fruits = ["apple", "cherry", "pineapple", "orange", "mango"]
If we want to select the first n elements of a list, we could use the following code:

fruits[:n]
For our fruits list, suppose we wanted to slice the first three elements.

The following code would start slicing from index 0 and up to index 3. Note that the fruit at index 3 (orange) is not included in the results.

print(fruits[:3])
Would output:

['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple']
We can do something similar when we want to slice the last n elements in a list:

fruits[-n:]
For our fruits list, suppose we wanted to slice the last two elements.

This code slices from the element at index -2 up through the last index.

print(fruits[-2:])
Would output:

['orange', 'mango']
Negative indices can also accomplish taking all but n last elements of a list.

fruits[:-n]
For our fruits example, suppose we wanted to slice all but the last element from the list.

This example starts counting from the 0 index up to the element at index -1.

print(fruits[:-1])
Would output:

['apple', 'cherry', 'pineapple', 'orange']
Let’s practice some of these extra slicing techniques!

Instructions
1.
Create a new list called last_two_elements containing the final two elements of suitcase.

Print last_two_elements to see your result.

Checkpoint 2 Passed

Hint
To slice the last n elements in a list:

fruits[-n:]
If we want to slice off the last two elements, what would n be?

2.
Create a new list called slice_off_last_three containing all but the last three elements.

Print slice_off_last_three to see your result.
"""

suitcase = ["shirt", "shirt", "pants", "pants", "pajamas", "books"]

# Your code below: 
last_two_elements = suitcase[-2:]
print(last_two_elements)

slice_off_last_three = suitcase[:-3]
print(slice_off_last_three)
